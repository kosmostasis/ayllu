    weight: 1.0
    description: >
      Measures whether the project enables global coordination (knowledge/capital/networks)
      while grounding action locally (place-based implementation, local partners, local benefit),
      avoiding extractive "remote control" dynamics.
    signals_positive:
      - "Supports local institutions/communities as co-owners/co-designers"
      - "Place-based pilots, recurring physical nodes, or durable local partnerships"
      - "Open playbooks/replicable methods that transfer capacity to local actors"
      - "Local value capture: jobs, services, infrastructure, skills, or revenue retained locally"

      - "Outsized central control; weak local autonomy"
      - "No evidence of local partners, pilots, or implementation"
    scoring_anchors:
      0: "Anti-local or extractive: explicitly bypasses/undermines local capacity; no local benefit."
      1: "Weak: global community exists, but no local grounding or local value capture."
      2: "Emerging: some local intent (chapters/events), but ad hoc and not tied to durable outcomes."
