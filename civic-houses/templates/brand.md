# Civic House — brand (template)

**Positioning:** Diaspora civic infrastructure — services, credentials, coordination. Complementary to host-state structures; no representation claims.

**Tone:** Practical, inclusive, host-nation respectful.

**Do:** Complement host-state structures; offer concrete value; be explicit about constraints.
**Don’t:** Claim to represent any state or government; use sovereign/diplomatic language.

Replace placeholders (e.g. “Venezuelans + allies”) per node context.
