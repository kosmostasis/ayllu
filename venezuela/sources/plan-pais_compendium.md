# Plan País compendium — canonical location

**The canonical compendium is maintained here:** [../spec/plan-pais_compendium.md](../spec/plan-pais_compendium.md)

That file includes the full mesa-by-mesa structure and the annex “What’s missing relative to AylluOS.” Edit only the spec version so there is a single source of truth.
