# Metrics — what to measure

So the network can learn and improve without imposing heavy overhead.

## Node-level (periodic, e.g. quarterly)

- **Activity** — number of events, format, approximate attendance.
- **Services** — which services were used (credentialing, opportunities, mutual aid, learning); rough volume where possible without violating privacy.
- **Incidents** — count and type (safety, conduct, dispute); outcomes (resolved, escalated, open).
- **Financial** — summary: income, expenditure, balance; confirm controls in place.

## Network-level (when applicable)

- Aggregate activity and service use across nodes.
- Common issues and improvements (e.g. dispute patterns, training needs).
- Pilot-city shortlist and new node pipeline.

## Privacy

- No personal data in metrics beyond what’s necessary and consented.
- Anonymize or aggregate when reporting to the network.
