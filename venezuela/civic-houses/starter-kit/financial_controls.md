# Financial controls (treasury + auditing for a node)

Civic House nodes that handle money must have clear controls.

## Principles

- **Transparency** — purpose of funds, who can spend, how much, and how often.
- **Separation** — node funds separate from personal funds; no commingling.
- **Audit** — periodic review (internal or external as scale requires).

## Minimum for a node

- One responsible treasurer; at least one other person with visibility (dual control where feasible).
- Written policy: what the node can spend on (e.g. venue, materials, mutual aid within agreed rules).
- Simple ledger: date, amount, purpose, approved by. Keep records.
- No large or unusual transactions without agreement of node leads.

## Reporting

- Report summary (e.g. quarterly) to node participants and, when applicable, to network metrics (see metrics.md).
- If the node dissolves, define in advance how remaining funds are used (e.g. return to donors, transfer to another node, charity).
