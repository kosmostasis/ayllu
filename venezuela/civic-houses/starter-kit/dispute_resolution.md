# Dispute resolution (tiered mediation)

When conflicts arise within a node or between participants.

## Tiers

1. **Informal** — direct conversation; node lead can facilitate if asked.
2. **Mediation** — neutral mediator (from node or network); voluntary; no binding outcome unless all agree.
3. **Escalation** — if mediation fails or the matter is serious (e.g. safety, fraud), document and follow host-country law. Network may support with process guidance but does not substitute for legal authority.

## Principles

- Confidentiality where possible without compromising safety or legal obligations.
- No retaliation for good-faith reporting or participation in mediation.
- Credential and contributions disputes: follow issuance/revocation policy when defined (see credentialing in service_catalog_v0.md).

## Who mediates

- Node: designate one or two people willing to mediate; they should not be party to the dispute.
- Network: when a shared protocol exists, network may maintain a list of trained mediators.
