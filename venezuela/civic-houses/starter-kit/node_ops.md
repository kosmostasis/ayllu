# How to start a Civic House (node ops)

A Civic House is a **node** in the diaspora civic infrastructure: place + services + protocol.

## Prerequisites

- Commitment to complementary posture and host-nation compliance.
- At least one responsible operator/lead.
- A partner venue or clear place strategy (see safety_and_conduct).

## Steps

1. **Read the starter kit** — brand, service catalog, safety, financial controls, dispute resolution.
2. **Define your node** — name, city, venue model, initial services.
3. **Safety & conduct** — adopt safety_and_conduct.md and ensure venue partner alignment.
4. **Financial controls** — set up treasury and auditing per financial_controls.md.
5. **Register with the network** (when registry exists) — identity, contact, service offerings.
6. **Launch with at least one concrete service** from the catalog (or an approved variant).
7. **Metrics** — report per metrics.md so the network can learn.

## Ongoing

- Regular ops review; update service catalog and events as needed.
- Participate in dispute resolution and protocol updates when invited.
