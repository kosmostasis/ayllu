# Safety and conduct

Every Civic House node must have a clear safety and conduct policy. This is the baseline.

## Place / venue

- Partner venues: agree with the venue on capacity, access, and emergency procedures.
- No one is required to share personal details beyond what’s needed for the activity.
- Safe exit: participants can leave at any time; no pressure to stay.

## Conduct

- Respect: no harassment, discrimination, or violence. Host-nation law applies.
- No solicitation of illegal activity; no representation claims.
- Disputes: follow dispute_resolution.md (tiered mediation).

## Incidents

- Designate a contact for reporting. Act on reports promptly and fairly.
- Serious or illegal behavior: document, support affected parties, and comply with host-country law (including reporting where required).

## Review

- Review this policy periodically and after any incident.
- Align with venue partner and update node_ops when policy changes.
