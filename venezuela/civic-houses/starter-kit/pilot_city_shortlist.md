# Pilot-city shortlist

Cities where Civic House nodes are prioritized for launch or already in early stage. Update as nodes form or priorities shift.

## Criteria (draft)

- Significant Venezuelan diaspora or ally presence.
- Host-nation context where complementary, host-compliant civic infrastructure is feasible.
- At least one potential operator/lead and venue or clear place strategy.
- Willingness to adopt starter-kit (brand, safety, financial controls, dispute resolution, metrics).

## Shortlist (initial)

| City | Region | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Miami | US | Candidate | Large diaspora; clarify venue and lead. |
| Madrid | Spain | Candidate | Strong diaspora; explore lead and venue. |
| Bogotá | Colombia | Candidate | Proximity and diaspora; host-nation alignment. |
| Lima | Peru | Candidate | Diaspora presence; assess lead and venue. |
| Panama City | Panama | Candidate | Hub; assess interest and capacity. |

*Add rows as candidates are identified. Change status to “Pilot” when a node is active and “Active” when operating per starter-kit.*
