# Cursor rules — AylluOS

## Path rules (hard)

- **Never output absolute paths** in patches, file operations, or generated content. Use repo-relative paths only (e.g. `scripts/...`, `ops/...`, `docs/...`).
- Hard-fail: if any path begins with `/Users/`, `~/` (when used as output target), or escapes repo via `../` → do not apply.
- External docs: import to `inbox/external_docs/` first; operate only on in-repo copy.

## Apply/merge failures

When Cursor apply-worktree or merge fails, follow `ops/DEBUG_WORKTREE_APPLY.md`. Prefer terminal `git cherry-pick` over Cursor apply.
