# Missing state muscles (statewide practices)

These are **practice standards** that every ministry must comply with — not ministries themselves.

- Evidence & evaluation
- Delivery discipline
- Data governance as infrastructure
- Maintenance + asset stewardship
- Foresight binds budgeting
- Trust/complaints/ombudsman loop
- Institutional memory (decision logs + postmortems)

Implement as `practice standards`; see `../schemas/practice_standard.schema.json`.
