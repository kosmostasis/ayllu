## 0) Positioning in one sentence
**AylluOS is civic infrastructure for coordinated national upgrading: modular, evidence-backed, mobile-first, and cosmo-local by design.**

Venezuela instance posture: **serious civic infrastructure** (credibility-first, non-coercive, complementary).

## 1) Tone: "competent, calm, precise"
- Default voice: **clear, civic, operational**
- Avoid breathless hype, utopia language, and messianic framing
- Use poetry **sparingly** as garnish (empty states, section openers), never in critical flows (identity, money, credentials)

### Do
- "Evidence-backed", "auditable", "complementary", "diaspora civic infrastructure"
- "Upgrade", "repair", "stewardship", "capacity", "delivery"
- "Cosmo-local": local problems visible at global scale; global resources grounded locally

### Don't
- "We represent Venezuela" / "government-in-exile" / "official"
- "Revolution", "takeover", "replace institutions"
- Overpromising ("fix the nation overnight")

## 2) Vocabulary map (public vs internal)
**Public-facing Venezuela app**
- "Civic House" (not "embassy")
- "Capabilities" / "Programs" (not "ministries" in UI)
- "Areas" (Education, Health, Justice…) rather than bureaucratic labels

**Internal / builder-facing AylluOS console**
- "Modules"
- "Country Runtime Config (CRC)"
- "COFOG mapping"
- CANON: *Ministry of State Capacity* and *Ministry of Future, Risk, and Civilizational R&D*

## 3) Narrative pillars (must appear across site, docs, decks)
1) **Cosmo-Localism**: global knowledge + capital + networks, locally grounded action  
2) **d/acc**: defense, decentralization, resilience, and safety in tech + governance  
3) **State capacity**: delivery discipline, evaluation, maintenance, and trust infrastructure  
4) **Non-coercive legitimacy**: complementary posture; no representation claims  
5) **Proof over promises**: provenance, hashes, confidence labels, measurable outcomes

## 4) Visual identity principles (minimal, civic, modern)
### The vibe
**Mission control meets civic house.**  
- Minimal geometry, strong typographic hierarchy, generous whitespace
- Subtle "cosmic" cues (constellation lines, starfield grain) only as background texture

### UI trust cues (mandatory)
- "Source" link on claims
- "Confidence" label on computed values
- "Method" or "Why this?" on rankings, recommendations, verifications

## 5) Copy system (microcopy + disclaimers)
### Universal footer disclaimer (Venezuela instance)
> This is diaspora civic infrastructure: complementary, non-coercive, and not a claim of representation.

### CTAs (consistent phrasing)
- Contribute knowledge
- Contribute capital
- Contribute network
- Join a Civic House
- Start a pilot
- Publish outcomes

## 6) Brand safety & guardrails
- Use `ops/GUARDRAILS.md` as source of truth for restricted language
- Any guardrail-triggered edits must be logged in `local_audit/guardrail_redactions.md` (local-only, gitignored)

## 7) Required reading for WS4
- This file
- `ops/GUARDRAILS.md`
- `ayllu/spec/COUNTRY_RUNTIME_SPEC.md`
- `network-states/rubric/rubric.yml` (axes definitions)
